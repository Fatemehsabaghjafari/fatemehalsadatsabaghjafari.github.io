						<h4>Smart bails</h4>
					</header>
				<article class="article">
					
					<p id="article-p">
						While watching cricket you may have paid attention, 
						whenever the wicketkeeper stumps the batsman, 
						the bails over the stumps fall and its LED lights start flashing very fast.
						These are actually smart bails that were inovaited some years ago.
						A microprocessor is placed in the bails to detect the bail is dislodged or not from the stump notch.
						The activation happens through a built in sensor and the LED lights begin blinking in the 1/1000th of a second as the bail completely dislodges from the stump.
						After that it begins flashing and also sends a radiowave signal to the stumps, which after receiving begins flashing immediately that means the wicket is gone.
						And the LED lights make the bails unique, especially during night games.
