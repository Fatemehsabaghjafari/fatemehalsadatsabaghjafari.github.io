					    A fully engaged fan experience is the finest in sports, 
					    and everyone has begun to use
					    a number of techniques to boost the passion 
					    and excitement of their most ardent supporters.
					    There is no other way to apply it effectively but 
					    to deploy creative fan interaction methods 
					    that rely on the greatest technological platforms.
					    TISA has developed UMPIRE and BRISK,
					    2 tools that will help you take your sports brand to the 
					    next level in relation to content generation and distribution.
					    Forums, fantasy leagues, and global fan organizations are
					    just a few instances of online fan participation.

						<h4>Smart bails</h4>
					</header>
					<p>
						While watching cricket you might have noticed, 
						whenever the wicketkeeper stumps the batsman, 
						the bails over the stumps fall and quickly light into colorful led.
						These are actually smart bails that were launched In 2013 by a firm named Zing Bails.
						When the bails were properly freed from the stumps,
						the goal was to make them glow.
						A microchip in the bails senses when touched amongst the stumps and the bails are lost.
						The bails are powered by a low-voltage battery,
						which lights up in less than 1/1000th of a second. 
						The 3rd umpire now analyses run-outs and stumpings swiftly.
						And the LED lights add a unique touch to the game for the spectators, 
						especially during night games.

						Disability and Accessibility
					</header>
					<p>
						Spectators of all types can now enjoy sports thanks to new innovation, 
						especially disabled fans who may have previously battled with barrier portions of events and venues.
						E-ticketing solutions as well as other contactless or automated services can also benefit disabled spectators.
						This allows them to avoid the challenges of a location that may lack wheelchair accessibility or disabled parking places near fan areas.
						Several venues have even introduced “in-seat delivery options”. 
						It allows spectators to purchase food and drinks and have them served to their seats as they watch the action. 
						For instance, many football clubs have started using big tv screens near the pitch,
						where fans can interact with players and even have a full in-stadium experience.
