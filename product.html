				<h3 id="pp">1global story about the product</3>
				<p>The idea of smart bails was generated by the two Australian based inovators called David Ligertood and Bronte Eckermann. It came up with an intresting story which lately become the global history. One day Bronte Eckermann was relaxing on his couch, drinking red wine and watching his daughter playing with the LED toys and an idea came up to his mind that why up to now we are not using the LED lights in cricket games. Soon he discussed with his business partner David to make it happen.It took almost three years to get the approval from ICC (International Cricket Council) and to implement in a real cricket game.So because of the higher accuracy it got more attention in the cricket game. </p>

				<h3>2what problem does this inovation solve?</3>
				<p>It has made the game easier because in order to dismiss the batsman the fielder or the wicket keeper had to uproot the stumps completely, so now with the smart bails it is very easy to push it rather than uprooting the stumps.</p>

				<h3>3how to use this inovation</3>
				<p>A microprocessor is placed in the bails to detect the bail is dislodged or not from the stump notch. The activation happens through a built in sensor and the LED lights begin blinking in the 1/1000th of a second as the bail completely dislodges from the stump. After that it begins flashing and also sends a radiowave signal to the stumps, which after receiving begins flashing immediately that means the wicket is gone. </p>

				<h3>4who is using this inovation</3>
				<p>Although the cricket game is divided into some categories like ODI(One Day International), Test match, T20 etc. But up to now it is used in T20 matches only because of its high budget.</p>

				<h3>5Expectaion from this inovation</3>
				<p>The cricket game had a sad story because of the wrong decisions from the umpire. Before this inovation the cricket had struggled with stumpping and run-out decisions as it was not easy to observe the specific point at which a bail has removed from the stump. So the inventor compay provided an easy and convenient solution. The smart bails would light up as soon as they were shifted. So the system has helped to make a decision by using every camera angle.  </p>

				<h3>6future </3>
				<p>Like most new inovations the smart bails had its share of dificulties in the manufacturing process. Since the game is played with a hard ball the  very first development had to withstand extreme force. So it was very though enough to be withstand against the velocity of 160kmph. The very first product were tried out in Australia's big bash league and then for the first time the product is used in an international tournament at the 2014 ICC world T20 in Bangladesh. So the international cricket has accepted the inovation happily that will help the product usable more globally for the future generations.</p>
